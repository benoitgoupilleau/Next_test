    <ul>
      <li>Create a new page that you will call "Blog"</li>
      <li>Fetch all the blog posts from the following API: https://servertest-bgoupilleau.herokuapp.com</li>
      <li>Display all blog posts in the blog page (title, text, image and date when they are available). The posts will have to be sorted by date</li>
      <li>Add whatever you think should be added. But don't forget to tell us what and why</li>

    <p>Note that the image of each blog is served by the API. The key "src" of each post indicates the endpoint on the API</p>
    <p>Example: "src: 'mypicture.png' means that the picture source is https://servertest-bgoupilleau.herokuapp.com/mypicture.png</p>
